Use this script to automatically grab playlists from DI.fm. It's pretty dirty, so I don't figure it'll be bulletproof. 

At it's basic usage, run this to get all free playlists in pls format:

di-fm-get_playlists.pl

To grab premium playlists, do the following:

di-fm-get_playlists.pl --premium --user='username' --pass='pass'

If you would prefer M3U formatted playlists, pass in the --m3u argument.
